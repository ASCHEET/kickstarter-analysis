#Kickstarting with Excel

## This project was requested by Louise after the success of her play 'Fever' came close to her fundraising goal in a short amount of time.

###  At her request, Louise has asked for other kickstarter campaignes to be analyized related to launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Over 4,000 Kickstarter campaigns were analyzed based on category, requested goal, date initiated, and based on if the fundraising goal was met or not.
### The compiled data started as far back as 2009 up to 2017 and included currently live crowd sourcing campaigns. However, the live campaigns were not overly helpful and for the most part
### were excluded from most analyses.  Categories included: film and video, food, games, journalism, music, photography, publishing, technology, and theater.

### The data was first refined to a Parent Category of 'Theater' and from those a subcategory exclusive of Plays was analyzed to most accurately reflect crowdfunding Louise would find helpful.
### This resulting data was organized by Launch Date and plotted based on the overall outcome.  See below in Figure 1.

### As you can see in Figure 1 above the best time to start a crowd sourcing campaign is late spring or early summer.  There was no real correlation to campaign start vs. failure to meet the funding goals.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals is shown below in Figure 2. ![Figure 2 - Funding Outcomes Based on Monetary Goal](C:\Users\ascheet\OneDrive - SESI, LLC\Documents\GitHub\practice\kickstarter-analysis-main.zip\kickstarter-analysis\Outcomes_vs.Goals.png)
### Figure 2 shows the probability of reaching the crowd funding goals based on the monetary amount requested.  As you can see, fundraising campaigns less than $5000, have a success rate of greater than 75%.  The trend is lower as the funding amount increases
### where is goes up to 75% for campaigns requesting for money between $25,000 and $35,000 dollars.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
